# K Means Clustering

You have to implement k-means algorithm to cluster a set of 1000 2D points. The data points (x,y) will be generated via Gaussian distribution.
* Implement K-means algorithm to cluster these points. K-means will take a set of points and the number of clusters (K) and will cluster the points into given number of clusters. The algorithm will stop if there is no significant change coming in positions of centroids. You can try giving different mean and variance to the Gaussian distribution to have different input points and check your code.
* Provide graphical visualization of the process of formation of clusters.
* Instead of running K-means once, run it 10 times and give the best clustering formation achieved. You need to identify the criteria to assess quality of clusters and then choose the best one.
* Kmeans asks you to provide number of clusters (K) as input. Do some research to identify clustering methods that do not ask for K. Give short description of one such algorithm.
